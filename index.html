                Pakistan, where the local Taliban had at times banned girls from attending school. Her advocacy has grown into an
                international movement, and according to former Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, she has become "the most
                prominent citizen" of the country.</p>

                         I was born in Mingora, Pakistan on July 12, 1997.
                        Welcoming a baby girl is not always cause for celebration in
                        Pakistan — but my father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, was determined
                        to give me every opportunity a boy would have.

                         My father was a teacher and ran a girls’ school in our
                        village. I loved school. But everything changed when the
                        Taliban took control of our town in Swat Valley. The
                        extremists banned many things — like owning a television and
                        playing music — and enforced harsh punishments for those who
                        defied their orders. And they said girls could no longer go
                        to school. In January 2008 when I was just 11 years old, I
                        said goodbye to my classmates, not knowing when — if ever —
                        I would see them again.

                <p class="timeline" id="twelve">I spoke out publicly on behalf of girls and our right
                    to learn. And this made me a target. In October 2012, on my
                    way home from school, a masked gunman boarded my school bus
                    and asked, “Who is Malala?” He shot me on the left side of
                    my head. I woke up 10 days later in a hospital in
                    Birmingham, England. The doctors and nurses told me about
                    the attack — and that people around the world were praying
                    for my recovery.

                     After months of surgeries and rehabilitation, I joined
                    my family in our new home in the U.K. It was then I knew I
                    had a choice: I could live a quiet life or I could make the
                    most of this new life I had been given. I determined to
                    continue my fight until every girl could go to school. With
                    my father, who has always been my ally and inspiration, I
                    established Malala Fund, a charity dedicated to giving every
                    girl an opportunity to achieve a future she chooses. In
                    recognition of our work, I received the Nobel Peace Prize in
                    December 2014 and became the youngest-ever Nobel laureate.

                        Now I am studying Philosophy, Politics and Economics at
                        the University of Oxford. And every day I fight to ensure
                        all girls receive 12 years of free, safe, quality education.
                        I travel to many countries to meet girls fighting poverty,
                        wars, child marriage and gender discrimination to go to
                        school. Malala Fund is working so that their stories, like
                        mine, can be heard around the world. We invest in developing
                        country educators and activists, like my father, through
                        Malala Fund’s Education Champion Network. And we hold
                        leaders accountable for their promises to girls. With more
                        than 130 million girls out of school today, there is more
                        work to be done. I hope you will join my fight for education
                        and equality. Together, we can create a world where all
                        girls can learn and lead.
